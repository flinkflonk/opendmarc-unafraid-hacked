OpenDMARC-unafraid and why you shouldn't use it
===============================================

This is my attempt of collecting all bugs, maybe find some bugs myself
and generally providing myself with a working source copy of OpenDMARC.

OpenDMARC was created as a project at TrustedDomain but left in a very
buggy state when development ceased there (I assume there was no budget
or people got other things to do... anyway, at least it was released
to the world as open source).

I do this patching and experimenting while I learn how to implement
DMARC for myself. That should tell you why this is not the version
you're looking for (actually, even the "official" version on
sourceforge.net might not be the version you're looking for...).

I called it opendmarc-unafraid because that's what you have to be
to use it :)
